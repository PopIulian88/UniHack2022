# unihack2022

#This is Social Card.

A project that is made by people for people.
This project is a website that has the main goal of helping people digitalize their business cards aka share their socials easier.

#This project is in the preAlpha release
And was invented and made in 48 hours during Unihack2022, so don't be so judgy if it's not ideal,
because it has atleast a cute purple cloudy design


#Examples of use of this project
Imagine you met a nice person while taking a bus ride on a rainy autumn day and you would like to continue the discussion, but now its their stop and they need to exit the bus. 

    What should you do?
You can try and tell them your Instagram tag or phone number or any other social website, but what if they don't have Instagram and only have Facebook?
But what if they don't have Telegram or Whatsapp?
You'll just loose that person forever.

#What's our idea?
#isn't implemeted yet
You'll just show them a qr code that they will scan in a few seconds and the code will link them to our magnificent website, where they will be able to find all the social info that you posted.
And voila, you are saved and got a new interesting person in your life thank to us.
